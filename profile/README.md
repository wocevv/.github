This project has been made for World of Content.

# The idea
The project idea is that members of World of Content can easily make a dashboard with different kind of widgets. There needs to be an option to make different kind of widgets, such as a barchart, piechart and linechart. Whenever you make a widget you can choose which datamodels you want to use and what you specifically want to see on that datamodel.


# Documentation
