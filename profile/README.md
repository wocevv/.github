# Welcome to team evvision!

# About us
We are a team of software students called evvision. evvision had 5 students Arthur Brouwers, Matthijs Dolmans,Rik Fieret, Casper van den Dijk, CÃ©dric Berden. This project has been made for woc (world of content).

# The idea
The project idea is that members of woc can easily make a dashboard with different kind of widgets. There needs to be an option to make different kind of widgets like a barchart, piechart and linegraph. Whenever you make a widget you can choose which datamodels you want to use and what you speceficly want to see on that datamodel.
