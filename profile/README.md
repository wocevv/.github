# About us

This project has been made for World of Content.

# The idea
The project idea is that members of World of Content can easily make a dashboard with different kind of widgets. There needs to be an option to make different kind of widgets, such as a barchart, piechart and linechart. Whenever you make a widget you can choose which datamodels you want to use and what you specifically want to see on that datamodel.

# How to run
To run the project, you have to run both the frontend and the backend.
For explanation on how to run the files, see the [Frontend](https://github.com/wocevv/Front-end) and [Backend](https://github.com/wocevv/wocevv-backend) documentation
